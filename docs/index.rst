   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to the eth-abi documentation!
=====================================

The ``eth-abi`` library provides low level utilities for converting python
values to and from solidity's binary ABI format.

For detailed information on ABI types and their encodings, refer to the
`solidity ABI specification
<https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/abi-spec.html>`_.

Though much of the code has been revised, the ``eth-abi`` library was
originally extracted from the ``pyethereum`` library which was authored by
Vitalik Buterin.
